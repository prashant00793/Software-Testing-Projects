# Software Testing Projects

This repository contains various software testing projects aimed at demonstrating different testing techniques and methodologies. Each project focuses on specific aspects of software testing and provides a comprehensive example for learning and practicing.

## Projects Included

1. **Unit Testing Framework**: This project demonstrates the implementation of a custom unit testing framework. It covers the fundamental concepts of unit testing, such as test cases, test suites, and assertions.

2. **Integration Testing**: This project showcases the integration testing process by testing the interaction between multiple software components. It emphasizes the importance of testing the integration points and ensuring proper functionality across different modules.

3. **Regression Testing**: In this project, we explore the concept of regression testing and its significance in ensuring that modifications or enhancements to software do not introduce new defects or impact existing functionality.

4. **Performance Testing**: The performance testing project focuses on evaluating the performance and scalability of software applications. It includes load testing, stress testing, and benchmarking techniques to assess system performance under different scenarios.

5. **Security Testing**: This project highlights the importance of security testing to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in software systems. It covers techniques such as penetration testing, security scanning, and code review to ensure robust security measures.
